# The Estimate-o-Meter

## Learning Meteor.js by Building a Planning Poker App.

### This needs a better name, I've already written ""beverage-o-meter" several times on accedent.

////

# An Unexpected Journey

* ### Inspired by last years unConf, going to learn moble app developemnt
* ### Made "hello world" for Android.
* ### "An API for planning poker would be easy to write."
* ### Python and Google's App Engine.
* ### Websockets.
* ### Node.js

////
 
# Meteor is great...

 * ### Lots of good resouces for learning.
 * ### Javascript everwhere and that's actually fun.
 * ### Real time, out of the box, always.
 * ### Lots of Pakages. It can use a lot of the Node.js stuff.
 * ### Magic. It works and you don't feel like you've done anything.

////

# Unexpected Education

 * ### MongoDB
 * ### Bootsrap 3
 * ### Nginx
 * ### underscore.js
 * ### Javascript

////

# Unexpected Difficulties

* ### New Framework. Life on the edge.
* ### Paradigm Shift (for me anyway).
* ### A real time Planning Poker app is complicated.

////

# Magic You Say?

* ### Distributed Data Protocol (DDP)
* ### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
* ### Reactivity (like AngularJS)
* ### Latency compensation.

////

# Is Meteor Right For...?

* ### Am I Building a Prototype? *YES!*
* ### If I don't want to use MongoDB? *NO! Maybe someday.*
* ### If I don't want to host a Node.js app? *No!*
* ### Does this need to be real time? *Maybe.*
* ### I require a battle tested stable enviornment? *NO! Maybe someday.*
* ### But what if I'm asking these questions in the future? *1.0 first quarter 2014.*
